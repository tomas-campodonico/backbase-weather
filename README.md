# backbase-weather
## Description
This is a sample application that shows the weather of five european cities. It consist on a simple SPA developed using AngularJS 1.5 and Twitter Bootstrap.

## Things to consider
* As one of the requirements was that the app should run by opening the index.html, templates have to be included inline because of CORS limitations.
* To keep it as simple and small as posible, I decided not to use a task runner, a CSS preprocessor or a package manager in the application. I usually use all of those tools in my projects.
* I had to create my own openweather account, as the app id in the pdf was expired. Also, I'm not sure if I'm using the correct endpoint for the forecast service. In the pdf file, both endpoint were the same.
